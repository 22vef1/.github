## Teddi's Resources

Teddi has chosen wood as his material. Tree of life from various places, that has a different texture, colour and shape. From driftwood that only few if any sees value for its practicality to expensive African ibenholt. The wood comes all corners of the world and brings us a message from there. We can observe the works from red ironwood from Malawi, Danish willow that a former Prime Minister Tryggvi Gunnarsson brought to Iceland to grow in the parliament garden around 1900, Elm from the Swedish embassy garden, tree-bobs from old fishing gears from the Westfjords, and the interplay of mahogny and copper from a fishing boat propeller.
